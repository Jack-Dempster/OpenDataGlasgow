                        <br>
                        <p>The rate of successful smoking quitters has fallen over the last 5 years by 5% in London and 17%
                            nationally. The quit rate in London has also decreased over the last year by 13%, whilst also
                            falling nationally by 20% (data shown is for quarter 3 of each financial year). The London quit
                            rates are still below the national average (3% lower in Q2 2013/14), though the gap is closing.
                            The GLA has supported improved training for more than 800 stop smoking service practitionersin
                            Londonto increase the quit rate of smokers.Further training courses to support an additional
                            100-200 practitioners have been coming online since early 2013. 19% of adults in London currently
                            smoke, compared with 21% in the UK.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p> Smoking related deaths within Scotland have decreased over the monitored time period. Almost a 50%
                            decrease in smoking related deaths. Can be compared to the amount of smoking quitters over the
                            last decade to prove that less people are smoking than before. Also coincides with the 2006 indoor
                            smoking ban which may have encouraged people to quit and therefore less smoking related deaths.</p>

                        <p>Period life expectancy at a given age for an area is the average number of years a person would live,
                            if he or she experienced the particular area√ïs age-specific mortality rates for that time period
                            throughout his or her life. Several studies have shown that geographical variations in life expectancy
                            can largely be accounted for by individual and area based deprivation or disadvantage. Life expectancy
                            figures are widely used by local health planners in monitoring health inequalities and in targeting
                            resources to tackle these inequalities in the most effective manner.

                        <p>Life expectancy at birth and at age 65 increased at a faster pace in London, compared with most other
                            regions between 2007-09 and 2011-13. In 2011-13, life expectancy at birth was highest in the
                            South East (80.4 years) for males and in London for females (84.1 years). In 2011-13 the gender
                            inequality in life expectancy was greatest in London (4.1 years). Nevertheless, these gaps are
                            narrower than they were in 2007-09. </p>

                            almost a 60% decrease over the time period shown. Glasgow has an overall higher rate of death
                            from Coronary Heart Disease than the rest of Scotland. More investigations could be undertaken
                            to try and understand why this is the case. Could be due to the large population skewing some
                            numbers or the fact that Glasgow is typically viewed as an unhealthy city overall.</p>
